/**
 * Base class for all aixyz plugins.

 * Plugins extend `BasePlugin` and implement one or both lifecycle hooks:
 *
 * - **`register(ctx)`** — Called by {@link AixyzApp.withPlugin}. Use `ctx.route()` and
 *   `ctx.use()` to register routes and middleware. Routes registered here are
 *   automatically tracked in {@link registeredRoutes}.
 *
 * - **`initialize(ctx)`** — Called by {@link AixyzApp.initialize} after all plugins
 *   have registered. Use `ctx.routes`, `ctx.getPlugin()`, and `ctx.payment` for
 *   cross-plugin discovery and late-binding (e.g., payment wrappers, UI generation).
 *
 * Both hooks are optional — a plugin may implement only `register` (most common),
 * only `initialize`, or both.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * class MyPlugin extends BasePlugin {
 *   readonly name = "my-plugin";
 *
 *   register(ctx: RegisterContext) {
 *     ctx.route("GET", "/health", () => Response.json({ ok: true }));
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
